📌 HTTP Overview

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for communication between clients (e.g., browsers, APIs) and servers. It follows a request–response model.

HTTP is stateless — each request is independent; sessions (state) are implemented with cookies, tokens, etc.

HTTP evolves (HTTP/1.1 → HTTP/2 → HTTP/3) mostly in how messages are framed and optimized, but core semantics (methods, status codes) remain consistent.

Messages are composed of:

Start line (method or status),

Headers (metadata),

Body (optional content).

🧠 HTTP Session Flow

(Summary of how a session/request works internally)

Client opens a connection (usually TCP) to server.

Client sends request with method + headers + optional body.

Server processes and sends response with status code + headers + optional body.

Connection may close or be reused (persistent connections, HTTP/2 multiplexing).

🚀 Common HTTP Request Methods

HTTP methods define the intent of a request.

Method	Meaning	Safe	Idempotent
GET	Retrieve resource	Yes	Yes
HEAD	Same as GET, no body	Yes	Yes
POST	Create resource or process data	No	No
PUT	Replace/update resource	No	Yes
PATCH	Partially update resource	No	Not necessarily
DELETE	Remove resource	No	Yes
OPTIONS	Query supported methods	Yes	Yes
<!-- CONNECT/TRACE are less commonly used in typical REST APIs. --> :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

Notes:

Safe means it should not change server state (e.g., GET, HEAD).

Idempotent means multiple identical requests have the same server effect (useful in retries).

🧾 HTTP Status Codes – Important Ones to Remember

Status codes are grouped by their first digit and tell the client what happened with the request.

✅ 1xx Informational

Rare in everyday use.

100 Continue – server got initial headers, client can send body.

✅ 2xx Success
Code	Meaning	Typical scenario
200 OK	Request succeeded	GET, POST success
201 Created	New resource created	POST/PUT creating resource
204 No Content	Successful, no body	DELETE success

2xx codes tell clients everything went well.

🔄 3xx Redirection
Code	Meaning
301 Moved Permanently	Resource permanently at new URL
302 Found	Temporary redirect
304 Not Modified	Cached response still valid

→ Browser may automatically follow Location header.

🚫 4xx Client Errors
Code	Meaning
400 Bad Request	Invalid client request
401 Unauthorized	Authentication required
403 Forbidden	Access not allowed
404 Not Found	Resource not found

→ These indicate issues with the request or client permissions.

❌ 5xx Server Errors
Code	Meaning
500 Internal Server Error	Generic server failure
502 Bad Gateway	Invalid response from upstream
503 Service Unavailable	Server overloaded/maintenance

→ These indicate server problems.

🧠 Quick Revision Cheat Sheet
Request Methods:

GET – read

POST – create/process

PUT – update/replace

PATCH – partial update

DELETE – delete

HEAD/OPTIONS – metadata & supported methods

Core Statuses:

200, 201, 204 → Success

301, 302, 304 → Redirection

400, 401, 403, 404 → Client errors

500, 502, 503 → Server errors

📌 Helpful Concepts

HTTP is stateless, but state can be managed on top (e.g., sessions/cookies).

The status line in a response includes version, status code, and reason phrase.

Headers help communicate control info (like caching, content type, etc.).

🌐 HTTP — Meaningful Revision Notes
1️⃣ What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web.

It defines how clients (browser, mobile apps, APIs) communicate with servers

Uses a request → response model

Runs on top of TCP/IP

Stateless by design → each request is independent

Any “state” (login, cart, preferences) is handled outside HTTP using cookies, tokens, or sessions.

2️⃣ Evolution of HTTP (Why versions matter)
🔹 HTTP/0.9

Very simple

Only supported GET

No headers, no status codes

🔹 HTTP/1.0

Introduced:

Headers

Status codes

Different HTTP methods

Still one request per connection (slow)

🔹 HTTP/1.1 (still widely used)

Persistent connections (keep-alive)

Chunked transfer encoding

Better caching support

Still suffers from head-of-line blocking

🔹 HTTP/2

Binary protocol (not text)

Multiplexing → multiple requests over one connection

Header compression

Faster, more efficient

🔹 HTTP/3

Built on QUIC (UDP) instead of TCP

Better performance on unstable networks

Avoids TCP connection delays

⚠️ Important:
Methods, status codes, and semantics stay the same across versions

3️⃣ HTTP Messages (Request & Response structure)
📤 HTTP Request

A request contains:

Request line

GET /users HTTP/1.1


Headers

Metadata (content type, auth, caching)

Body (optional)

Used mainly with POST, PUT, PATCH

Example:

POST /login HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{ "username": "abc", "password": "xyz" }

📥 HTTP Response

A response contains:

Status line

HTTP/1.1 200 OK


Headers

Body (optional)

Example:

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json

{ "error": "User not found" }

4️⃣ HTTP Sessions & State Management

Since HTTP is stateless, sessions are managed using:

🍪 Cookies

Stored in the browser

Automatically sent with each request

Can store:

Session ID

Preferences

Security flags:

HttpOnly

Secure

SameSite

🔐 Tokens (JWT, OAuth)

Sent explicitly via headers

Common in REST APIs

Stateless on server side

🧠 Server-side sessions

Server stores session data

Client holds session ID

5️⃣ HTTP Methods (Common & Practical)
Method	Purpose	Typical Use
GET	Fetch data	Read resource
POST	Submit data	Create resource
PUT	Replace resource	Full update
PATCH	Partial update	Update specific fields
DELETE	Remove resource	Delete
HEAD	Headers only	Check resource metadata
OPTIONS	Supported methods	CORS, preflight
Concepts to remember:

Safe → Does not modify data (GET, HEAD)

Idempotent → Same result if repeated (GET, PUT, DELETE)

POST is NOT idempotent

6️⃣ HTTP Status Codes (Only the commonly used ones)
🟢 2xx – Success
Code	Meaning	When used
200 OK	Success	GET, PUT
201 Created	Resource created	POST
204 No Content	Success, no body	DELETE
